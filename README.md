# Problem Statement
Predicting the vacation rate for popular tourist destinations across the globe.

The vacation rate is an essential metric for organizations involved in tourism as it helps them determine which destinations to promote during specific times of the year. It is believed that the vacation rate is dependent on various factors, such as temperature, humidity, and surface pressure.

To assist customers in planning their dream vacations, accurate prediction of the vacation rate is necessary. Historical data from a popular tourist destination has been collected, and expertise is required to create a predictive model that can forecast the vacation rate with high accuracy.

Analyzing the provided dataset and utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the vacation rate based on temperature, humidity, and surface pressure. Preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering, and selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm are necessary steps in building a predictive model.

The analysis and predictive model developed are expected to provide more accurate and personalized vacation recommendations to enhance the customer experience. The endeavor offers an opportunity to delve into the world of data science and its applications in the domain of tourism.

This uses the POWER NASA Temperature Dataset to develop accurate forecasting models. The dataset offers historical weather readings from various locations around the world.
